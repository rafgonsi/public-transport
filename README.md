# public-transport

code in Polish :/

Simulation of city life. Citizens having their daily activities eg. teens going to school, other people going to work on weekdays. These places are localized in different parts of the city and people get there by trams, which travel according to their time tables.

The project is unfinished, but still the following functionalities work:
- reading city parameters from .txt file (parameters eg. number of days of simulation, number of people, number of trams, their stops, etc.)
- people having their homes from which they travel to other places in the city
- students going to schools according to their timetables, which are randomly generated at the beginning of the simulation
- trams travelling on their lines according to their time tables. They allow people to get from one place to the other
- people are able to decide which tram they should take to get to their destination place (works only if no tram change is needed)
- the simulation prints every event that happens
